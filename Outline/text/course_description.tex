In geochemistry, we use the tools of chemistry to understand the Earth and how it works. Principles of thermodynamics and kinetics will be applied to understand key processes that control of the geochemistry of the Earth, from the low temperature and pressure conditions of Earth's surface environment to higher temperature and pressure conditions in Earth's interior. We will consider processes operating on time scales of millions (planetary formation) to hundreds (climate change) of years. The lab will provide hands-on experience using real data to solve geological problems.
