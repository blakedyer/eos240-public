In this lab, you will use peridotites and chondritic meteorites to build
a geochemical model of Earth’s upper mantle. In the first question, you
will compare variations in Mg, Al, and Si in Lherzolite xenoliths to
variations in chondritic meteorites to determine a subset of xenoliths
that may represent pristine (unmelted) upper mantle. In question 2, you
will compare the average composition of this subset of samples to the
volatile rich CI chondrites. To explain some of the chemical differences
you will find between Earth’s mantle and CI chondrites, you will rely on
your understanding of the Goldschmidt element classification scheme and
element condensation temperatures.
