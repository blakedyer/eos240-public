In this lab, you will compare **Ni** concentrations in olivines to
modeled predictions of **Ni** concentrations during *batch* and
*fractional* crystallization. You will find the partition coefficients,
:math:`D`, that best fit each crystallization model, and you will
compare those results to experimentally determined partitioning for
**Ni** to argue for which crystallization model more accurately
describes the magmatic system that these olivine samples formed in.
Recall:

The **partition coefficient**, :math:`D`, describes the ratio of
concentrations for an element between a mineral and a melt at
equilibrium:

.. math:: D=\frac{C_S}{C_L}

**Batch crystallization** describes a scenario where some fraction of a
magmatic system crystallizes and remains in equilbrium with the liquid.

.. math:: \frac{C_S}{C_0}=\frac{D}{F+D(1-F)}

**Fractional crystallization** describes the continuous removal of
mineral percipitates from a melt:

.. math:: \frac{C_S}{C_{0}}=D(F)^{D-1}

C is the concentration of a trace element. Subscript L represents the
melt phase. Subscript S represents the solid phase. C\ :math:`_0` means
at the initial conditions when melt is 100% of the system. D is the
partition coefficient, and F is the melt fraction (where 1 is 100%
melt).
